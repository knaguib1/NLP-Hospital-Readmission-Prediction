intraoperative course was uneventful   He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit postoperatively in an intubated condition   He remained intubated overnight and was in a stable condition   He was extubated on postoperative day one   He remained in atrial fibrillation at this time   He was started on a diltiazem drip for the atrial fibrillation with a rate of 150s   He underwent a bronchoscopy which showed mild anastomotic edema and was therefore continued on diuresis  He remained in the Intensive Care Unit for the next few days slowly improving with aggressive respiratory treatment   His Coumadin was restarted on postoperative day three   He was continued on antibiotics of vancomycin and Flagyl which had been started in the initial postoperative period   On postoperative day six  he complained of some left lower extremity pain   He underwent a lower extremity noninvasive study which revealed a left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis   At this point  he was started on Lovenox as he was not yet therapeutic on his Coumadin   On    2170 4 10     he underwent another bronchoscopy which again revealed mucosal edema at the anastomotic site   In the next few days in the Intensive Care Unit were essentially uneventful as he slowly improved  and his respiratory function was slowly improving   He was deemed ready for transfer to the regular floor on postoperative day eight   He was stable on the floor over the next few days   His Coumadin was continued until it reached a therapeutic level  and at that point the Lovenox was stopped  He continued to have left leg pain secondary to the deep venous thrombosis and was treated with a morphine patient controlled analgesia   He had aggressive respiratory toilet as well at this point   His clinical condition slowly improved  and he started ambulating  and his respiratory function improved as well   On postoperative day 16     2170 4 20      he went back to the operating room for a bronchoscopy   At that time  his airways were clean  and there was no mucosal edema   He was now ready for discharge home on Coumadin   MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE   1   Diltiazem 120 mg p o  b i d   2   Lisinopril 10 mg p o  q d

Service   TRA   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS   Acute right middle cerebral artery occlusion  stroke  following four vessel angiogram  left subdural hematoma  C7 fracture  glaucoma  question of hydrocephalus and a right total knee replacement   HOSPITAL COURSE   The patient was a 78 year old woman with a history of hypertension  glaucoma and dementia who was found unconscious by her bed by her brother and wife   She was taken to an outside hospital and found to have a C6 7 fracture and sent to    Hospital1 69     Hemodynamically stable in the hospital but on route she had an episode of confusion and in the hospital with garbled speech   Neurologic examination was intact at the time   She had no complaints of pain on arrival   Neurosurgery was consulted for the subdural hematoma and on    2139 7 27     she underwent a four vessel angiogram   After    2139 7 27     four vessel angiogram  the patient was noted to have signs and symptoms consistent with a right cerebrovascular accident   The four vessel angiogram was to rule out vertebral artery dissection   Per Dr     First Name  STitle       throughout the procedure  she was conversant  though slightly agitated  but she was given 0 5 mg of Midazolam times two  She remained conversant until just after the right carotid was imaged at which time she manifested garbled speech   On examination  she had garbled speech and was uncooperative with motor examination although she was moving all extremities but decreased on the left   Head CT showed no focal lesions  however  magnetic resonance imaging showed silent embolus of middle cerebral artery and accordingly Dr     Last Name  STitle      of neurology stroke was consulted   Trauma surgery considered transfer of patient to    Hospital6     for neurosurgery intervention  however  this was not possible due to procedure space availability      Hospital6 15291    already had another intervention team to complete another  emergent procedure until 10 00 p m  when the window for intervention would have been ended   Therefore  the plan was for supportive care   No Aspirin or Heparin was provided per neurosurgery because of her left subdural hematoma   The patient s course in the Intensive Care Unit continued to improve at which point on    2139 8 1     she was transferred to the floor   The patient then required a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube for feeding which was placed on    2139 8 4     without incident   She was started on tube feeds and tolerated that well   She is currently no full strength tube feeds at 60 cc hour   The patient continued to improve throughout the hospital course   CONDITION ON DISCHARGE   Fair   MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE  1  Bisacodyl 10 mg p o  or PR as needed  2  Metoprolol 12 5 mg twice a day  3  Aspirin

The plan at the CCU was to place a temporary pacer wire so that rate control therapy could be safely started once a back up rhythm could be guaranteed by the temporary pacer  Venous cannulation was unable to be acheived at the bedside  However  during the attempts to place the venous cannula  the pt converted to sinus rhythm at 70 80 bpm      Past Medical History  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE

Mild to moderate     12 26      aortic regurgitation is seen  The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened  The mitral valve shows characteristic rheumatic deformity  There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae  There is a minimally increased gradient consistent with trivial mitral stenosis  Moderate to severe  3   mitral regurgitation is seen   Due to acoustic shadowing  the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated   There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension  There is no pericardial effusion  Compared with the prior

A fib on admission  developed long symptomatic ventricular pauses with rate control therapy  pacemaker was placed successfully in order to safely rate control      Rhythm  The pt described symptoms of increased fatigue and SOB on admission  She was noted to be in rapid Afib  She was initially rate controlled with dilt and metoprolol on the medicine floor  However  the pt was noted on the telemetry to have periods of    4 28    seconds of asysole  during which she felt light headed and nauseous  The pt was transferred to the CCU for more intensive monitoring  Attempted placement of catheter for temporary pacer was not successful  though pt converted to NSR  The pt was counseled regarding the benefits of permanent pacemaker so that the heart rhythm could be more successfully controlled  and she was amenable to this solution  The device was implanted successfully without complications  In terms of medical therapy Amiodarone for rate control and to attempt maintenence of sinus rhtyhm  For medical therapy  beta blocker and digoxin were used for rate control  Amiodarone was added to maintain sinus rhythm  but was later discontued after the pt developed symptoms of mental status changes
